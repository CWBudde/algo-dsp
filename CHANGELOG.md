# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New public package `dsp/interp` with reusable cubic Hermite interpolation (`Hermite4`) and a configurable `LagrangeInterpolator`.
- New public package `dsp/delay` with reusable circular delay-line primitives, including integer and fractional-delay reads.
- Added `core.FlushDenormals` for denormal-safe hot loops.

- Phase 14 API stabilization artifacts: `API_REVIEW.md`, `MIGRATION.md`, and `BENCHMARKS.md`.
- Runnable examples for previously uncovered major public packages:
  - `dsp/buffer`
  - `dsp/core`
  - `dsp/signal`
  - `stats/time`
  - `stats/frequency`

### Changed

- Benchmark code in `measure/ir` and `measure/sweep` now handles returned errors to satisfy release lint gates.
- Public implementation comments were cleaned to remove open work-item markers in Phase 14-facing code.

### Fixed

- Removed unused helper in `measure/ir/ir_test.go` flagged by lint.
- Applied formatting fixes in IR/sweep package files.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Initial reusable DSP package scaffolding across:
  - `dsp/window`, `dsp/conv`, `dsp/resample`, `dsp/spectrum`, `dsp/signal`
  - `dsp/filter/{biquad,fir,design,bank,weighting}`
  - `measure/{thd,sweep,ir}`
  - `stats/{time,frequency}`
- Core utilities in `dsp/core` and buffer utilities in `dsp/buffer`.
- Test and benchmark coverage across algorithm packages.
